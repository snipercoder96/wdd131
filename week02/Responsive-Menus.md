# Overview
The purpose of this activity is to build a responsive menu using JavaScript. The menu will adapt to different viewport sizes and also respond when the user clicks on a "hamburger" button (≡). In responsive design, our objective is to provide users with a positive and familiar experience.

They allow us to clean up layouts because they save space on the page.
