# Pseudo class
 A pseudo-class is used to define a special `state` of an element. For example, it can change the color of a button when the user hovers over it with their cursor.

 ``` css
.call:hover  {
    background-color: #fff;
}

 ```

## More examples of Pseudo Classes:
:open

Matches an element that can either be open or closed that is currently open.


# Pseudo Elements
