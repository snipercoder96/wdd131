<!--Imagine you’re building a tiny app called “Favorite Hobby Tracker.”

User Input

The user types their hobby into a text field.

This is where .value comes in — it represents what they typed.

Event Handling

As soon as they type, an event fires (input event).

The app reacts by showing their hobby live on the page.

Persistence with localStorage

When they click “Save,” the hobby is stored in localStorage.

If they refresh the page, the app retrieves the saved hobby and shows it again.-->
